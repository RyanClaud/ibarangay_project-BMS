FIREBASE ADMIN SDK SETUP - FINAL STEP
======================================

You've installed firebase-admin successfully!

Now you need to get your Firebase credentials:

STEP 1: Go to Firebase Console
-------------------------------
1. Open: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select your project
3. Click the gear icon ⚙️ (top left)
4. Click "Project Settings"

STEP 2: Get Service Account Key
--------------------------------
1. Click "Service Accounts" tab
2. Click "Generate New Private Key" button
3. Click "Generate Key" in the popup
4. A JSON file will download - KEEP IT SAFE!

STEP 3: Create .env.local File
-------------------------------
1. In your project root (where package.json is), create a file named: .env.local
2. Copy this template into .env.local:

FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id-here
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYour-Private-Key-Here\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"

3. Open the downloaded JSON file
4. Copy these values:
   - "project_id" → FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
   - "client_email" → FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL  
   - "private_key" → FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY (keep the quotes and \n characters!)

STEP 4: Restart Your Server
----------------------------
1. Stop your dev server (Ctrl+C)
2. Run: npm run dev
3. Done!

STEP 5: Test It
---------------
1. Log in as admin
2. Go to Staff & Users
3. Click "Add Staff"
4. Create a staff member
5. NO MORE ERROR SCREENS! ✅

IMPORTANT NOTES:
----------------
- NEVER commit .env.local to git (it's already in .gitignore)
- Keep your service account key secure
- The private key must keep the \n characters (they represent newlines)
- Wrap the private key in quotes

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
If you get errors:
1. Check all three environment variables are set
2. Verify the private key has \n characters
3. Make sure you restarted the server
4. Check the browser console for specific errors

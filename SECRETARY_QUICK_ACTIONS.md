## Color Coding

- 🟢 **Green Button** = Mark as Ready for Pickup
- 🔵 **Blue Button** = Mark as Released
- ⚪ **White Button** = View Receipt (info only)

## For Your Certificate of Indigency Example

Looking at your screenshot, the document shows:
- Status: "Approved"
- Badge: "Free - No Payment Required"

### What Should Happen:

**Automatic (when Captain approves)**:
```
Status changes from "Approved" → "Payment Verified"
(This happens automatically for free documents)
```

**Then Secretary sees**:
```
Status: Payment Verified
[✓ Mark Ready] ← Green button appears
```

### If Status is Still "Approved":

The auto-skip might not have triggered. To fix:

**Option 1: Captain Re-approves**
- Captain clicks "Approve Request" again
- System will auto-skip to "Payment Verified"

**Option 2: Manual Update**
- Admin can manually change status to "Payment Verified"
- Then Secretary can proceed

**Your Workflow**:
